                A glance about my "Career Path". <br>
            </h3>
            <p>
                I was born in 1993 in Bac Ninh - a small town in the north of Vietnam. <br>
                In 2011, I started to study Computer Science at 
                <a href="https://e.uet.vnu.edu.vn/">University of Engineering and Technology - 
                    Vietnam National University, Hanoi</a>.<br>
                I got my bachelor degree in September 2015. <br>
                After that I worked as software engineer at 
                Viettel Research and Development Institute from 2015 to 2019. <br>
                This company has renamed to 
                Viettel High Technology Industries Coporation (VHT). 
                You can find more information about this company 
                <a href="http://viettelrd.com.vn/en/">here</a>.<br>
                In 2019, I moved to Pisa, Italy to start my master degree in Computer Science at 
                <a href="http://unipi.it">University of Pisa</a>.<br>

                You can find some of my work in this Github account,
                most of them are the projects I have done for my master degree. <br>
                And, one of my most favorite way to kill spare time is reading, 
                so I also maintain an active 
                <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60528712-pham-giang"> Goodreads account</a>.<br>

            <h3>
                Some of my skills (professonal skills, language skills, soft skills or even non-sense skills...)
            </h3>
            <p>
                I got my IELTS certificate in May 2017 with overall of 6.5. 
                In detail: Reading: 8.0; Speaking: 5.5; Writing 7.0; Listening: 6.0. <br>
                I am very familiar with C++ and it is also my most favorite programming language. 
                The reason is that I have controlling issue and C++ gives me a great power to control many things. <br>
                Besides, I can also deal well with Python especially with Jupyter Notebook. <br>
                And, you can see I made this page myself so I am also fine with javascript and html at the beginning level. 
                In need, I can spend time to learn more about them. <br>
                I had long term experience with Linux (Ubuntu) before transfering to MacOS (because I bought my stupid Macbook. 
                Don't get me wrong, I like Macbook and Apple's stuffs a lot, that is the reason I bought them). <br>
                At least, don't get panic attack when I have to speak in front of many people. 
                I think it is also worthy to consider as a skill. That is the reason I put it here. <br>
                I can do teamwork but it is not my favorite way of working. I am more productive when I can work alone, on my own.
                But teamwork is not a huge problem for me as long as I am not the leader and all the tasks are well defined. <br>
